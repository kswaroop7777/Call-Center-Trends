Call Center Trends â€“ Data Analysis Dashboard

Project Description:
This project involves the development of an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize call center performance metrics. Built using Microsoft Power BI, the dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key call center indicators to support data-driven decision-making and performance monitoring.

Key Features:
Total Call Volume Tracking:
Displays the total number of calls handled (e.g., 633), enabling quick insights into call traffic.

Agent Performance Metrics:
Analyzes individual agent metrics including:

Number of calls handled

Call abandonment rate

Speed of answer

Call resolution rate

Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)

Customer Satisfaction Analysis:
Visual representation of call satisfaction levels ranging from very satisfied to dissatisfied.

Hourly and Daily Call Volume Charts:
Line and bar charts show call distribution across hours of the day and days of the week to identify peak times and trends.

Filters for Dynamic Analysis:
Allows filtering data by agent name, topic, and weekday to focus on specific performance areas.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Highlights vital metrics such as:

CSAT (68.95)

Call resolved percentage (90.06%)

Call abandonment percentage (17.38%)

Average speed of answer (67.28 seconds)

Average handling time (191.01 seconds)

Tools & Technologies Used:
Power BI (for dashboard development and data visualization)

Excel/CSV (assumed for data source)

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions for calculations)

Objective:
To provide real-time, actionable insights into call center operations, enabling managers to track performance, identify bottlenecks, and enhance overall customer service quality.
